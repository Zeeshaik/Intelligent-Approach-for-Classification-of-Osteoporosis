# Intelligent-Approach-for-Classification-of-Osteoporosis
This project aims to develop an intelligent approach for the classification of osteoporosis using deep learning techniques. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train our model on a dataset of bone X-ray images, and then use the trained model to classify new X-ray images into different categories based on their severity of osteoporosis.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of bone X-ray images of different patients, categorized into 5 classes based on their severity of osteoporosis: Normal, Doubtful, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before being used for training the CNN model.

# Model
We use a CNN model built using the Keras library in Python. The model architecture consists of 3 convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU activation and max-pooling layers, and 2 dense layers. The final layer is a softmax activation layer that outputs the predicted class probabilities.

We train the model on the preprocessed dataset using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. We use a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and apply dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

# Evaluation
We evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset and report the accuracy of the model on the test set. We also generate a confusion matrix to visualize the classification performance of the model.

# Deployment
To use the trained model for predicting the class of new X-ray images, we provide a sample code to load the model from the saved .h5 file and process new images to obtain the predicted class.
